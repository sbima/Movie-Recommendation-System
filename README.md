# Movie-Recommendation-System
Depending upon the ratings given to the multiple movies by the multiple users, the system can recommend some movies to the user. This design is to be done using CUDA programming on GPU.

I am using c based CUDA programming to parallelize the ALS(Alternating Least Squares) algorithm on GPU. ALS is the algorithm by using which the system decides what movies are to be recommended to a particular user.
